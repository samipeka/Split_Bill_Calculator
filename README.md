# Split_Bill_Calculator
Split the bill and tip with friends

# Creating Tip calculator, my solution >

#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
#Tip: There are couple of ways to round a number.    round(8 / 3, 2) for 2 decimals - but this won't work for floats that end with 0 like 33.6 -so I formatted the result to .2 .
